      "desc:8": "Unlike its counterpart from the original mod, the Magma Drill does not literally drill into the depths. It is designed for extracting magma from Moho, which, as known, is abundant on this planet both on the surface and in caves. To start working, the mechanism must be installed directly on the surface of a lava lake so that the lava touches the drill head and reaches the edges of the recess. Supply power to the drill, and it will operate automatically.\n\nMagma is output through casting channels into molds. Cooled magma forms Vulcanite, which should then be processed to obtain useful resources.\n\nIn addition to volcanite, the device extracts regular slag (much more than Vulcanite).",
