      "desc:8": "The orbital station is a very heavy load for a rocket. If you want to launch it from Earth, you will need a multi-stage rocket with a huge amount of fuel and the most powerful engines. (Which is very inefficient) Launching the station from the Moon (Muna) is much easier and cheaper.\n\nOn Earth or the Moon, use a radio telescope to program an empty disk for the orbital station - place it in the telescope slot and press the ORB button. At the signal processing station, make a copy of the disk.\n\nAssemble a rocket with the station on board.\n\nLaunch the rocket from the launch pad with the disk. A few seconds after launch, the station will deploy in orbit around the Moon.\n\nThat\u0027s it! Assemble another rocket to the station (you will need a copy of the disk to the station) and fly. The station code on all disks must match, otherwise you won\u0027t be able to get to it! (I warned you!)",
