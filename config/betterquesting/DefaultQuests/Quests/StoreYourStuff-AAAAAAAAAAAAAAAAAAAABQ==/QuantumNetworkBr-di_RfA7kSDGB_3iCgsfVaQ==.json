      "desc:8": "A Quantum Network Bridge is a multiblock structure that connects 2 potentially distant network fragments together. Created by crafting 8 ME Quantum Ring and a ME Quantum Link Chamber and placing the ME Quantum Link Chamber in the center, and sourrounding it in the 8 ME Quantum Ring.\n\nEach Quantum Network Bridge requires power to function. This power must be provided from the network fragment it is attached to until the bridge is linked; at which time power from either side will be available. However if power is lost, connectivity will fail and power will be drained from the side the bridge is on in attempt to restore connection.\n\nTo establish a link between 2 Quantum Network Bridges, you must create a pair of Quantum Entangled Singularities. One of each will be placed inside of a particular connection. Each Bridge may only connect to one other bridge.\n\nAE2 Singularities are created by dumping 256k of any block inside a Matter Condenser. Singularities can become Quantum Entangled by dropping a Singularity and Ender dust and then exploding them together.",
