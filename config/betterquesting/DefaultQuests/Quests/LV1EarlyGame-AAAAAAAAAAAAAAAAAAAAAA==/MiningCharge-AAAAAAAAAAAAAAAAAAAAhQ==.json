      "desc:8": "The §3Mining Charge§r is an explosive made with the express purpose of mining, as such it\u0027s commonly used to mine depth ores, since it dosen\u0027t destroy drops, before getting a pickaxe that can do the same. Mining Charges are a great way of obtaining §6Zirconium§r from depth ores for nuclear fuel rods.\n\nIt has an explosion radius of about 3 blocks and explodes instantly upon being powered by redstone, while exploding it does no damage to entities.\n\nThere are two other variants of this, being the §3Timed Mining Charge§r and the §b§3Semtex Mining Charge§r, they are both timed explosives with the semtex one being stronger than the regular one and having §eFortune 3§r, meanwhile the timed mining charge does not seem to have enhanced capabilities, other than being timed and thus more convinient to use.",
