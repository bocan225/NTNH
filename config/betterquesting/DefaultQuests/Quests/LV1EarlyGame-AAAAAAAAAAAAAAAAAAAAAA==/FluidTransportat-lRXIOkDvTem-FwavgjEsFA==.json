      "desc:8": "A §6Universal Fluid Duct§r is a device for transporting liquids.\n\nMany mechanisms use various types of §9fluids§r. They have ports to which pipes are connected for input and output. The pipes themselves are not preset to the desired fluid type. To configure a pipe to carry a specific fluid, you must select the corresponding §6Fluid Identifier§r and right-click on each section of the pipe. This configures the pipe. You can switch the liquid type by doing the same with a different identifier. Without configuration, pipes are useless.\n\nWhen you hover over a pipe, a tooltip appears showing the fluid type it can currently carry. For convenience, pipes also have special markings that match the color of the configured fluid (or are completely painted).\n\nCurrently, there are §6classic§r and §6Boxduct§r-type pipes. There are three types of classic pipes, each using different metals in crafting. Boxduct pipes vary not only in composition but also in size (5 variations determine their flow capacity). Despite their appearance, all pipes are interconnected and can serve as an extension of another.\n\nIn addition to standard fluid pipes, there is a block-type variation: the §6Paintable Coated Universal Fluid Duct§r, which can be disguised as any block. To do this, simply right-click the desired block on the pipe. Only the pipe connectors will be visible.\n\n§2Pipes have no length restrictions, and the amount of fluid in them remains constant.\n\nPipes containing different fluids cannot be interconnected.",
