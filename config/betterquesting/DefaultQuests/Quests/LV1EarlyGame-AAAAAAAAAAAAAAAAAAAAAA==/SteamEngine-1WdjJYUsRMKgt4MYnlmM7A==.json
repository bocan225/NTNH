      "desc:8": "The §3Steam Engine§r is an early game method of turning §bSteam§r into energy. It requires an external source to provide steam and a way to dump or reprocess the §bLow-Pressure Steam§r it produces. \n\nThe Steam Engine has an energy efficiency of §e85%§r, making it better than the §3Stirling Engine§r. However, it still has a throughput limit as it can only hold up to 2000 mB of steam. Its maximum processing rate is 2000 mB/t, producing a considerable §e3400 HE/t§r or §e68 kHE/s§r. It is therefore the best generator available before §3Steam Surbines§r.\n\nA boiler being heated up by a heating oven using coal will produce §e17kHE/s§r.",
