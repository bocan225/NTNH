It also can only be mined by explosives or by pickaxes with the ability to mine blocks with this property.\n\nIt is however, affected by the fortune enchantment, so it is highly recommened to mine with this enchantment.\n\n§2Alexandrite ores can be detected by Neutrino Lens, and will be seen on its GUI with a bright blue color.\n\nWith some chance, it can be obtained from a meteorite treasure block, as well as from the Red Room. Or it can be extracted from a broken wooden toaster on an anvil.§r\n...\n§c(Wooden toaster?)",
