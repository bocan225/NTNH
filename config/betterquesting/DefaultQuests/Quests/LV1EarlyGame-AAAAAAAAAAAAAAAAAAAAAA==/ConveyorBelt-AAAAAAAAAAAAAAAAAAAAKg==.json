      "desc:8": "§3Conveyors§r provide the simplest way of moving items around. There are multiple blocks that can interface with machines as well as items moving along conveyor belts.\n\n§3Conveyor Belts§r are blocks used to transport items. They can pick up dropped items or items from conveyor ejectors. Conveyor inserters can take items from conveyor belts. If there are no conveyor inserters present, the item will be dropped at the end of the conveyor belt line.\n\n§3Conveyor Inserters§r are blocks that take items from conveyor belts and outputs them into a storage space. Conveyor ejectors are the opposite, they take items from storage and place them onto conveyor belts. \n\nInserters have an option to destroy surplus items if the input buffer has run full, otherwise the items that can neither be inserted in the target nor the inserter\u0027s buffer is simply dropped.\n\nThe ejector has a whitelist/blacklist system (the default mode is blacklist with no restrictions - this means that everything will go through). Rick-clicking the white arrow will toggle between whitelist and blacklist. An item can be added to the blacklist/whitelist by \"depositing\" it into the blue inventory square - the item will not be consumed, however.\n\nThe §3Conveyor Splitter§r is a type of conveyor belt that splits items evenly onto 2 lanes.\n\n§3Conveyor Sorters§r are blocks that can sort various items to a specific conveyor belt. They do not have a buffer and simple move items to connected conveyor belts based on their filter options, therefore they can sort items as quickly as they receive them.\nThe sorter has six outputs with five slots each, making it able to route multiple items to one belt.",
