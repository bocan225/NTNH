To perform a test, right-click the analyzer on wires or mechanisms in the power grid. The tool displays the following data:\n\n§eLinks§r - these include wires and mechanisms that can carry energy (e.g., energy storage facilities, utility poles).\n\n§9Providers§r - all mechanisms capable of producing energy and/or feeding it into the grid (energy storage facilities in \"green\" and \"orange\" modes, turbines, etc.).\n\n§cReceivers§r - everything that absorbs energy from the grid (energy storage facilities in \"blue\" mode, shredders, and other mechanisms).\n\n§2The analyzer not only displays the above components but also counts them. Each network is assigned a unique code.",
