To perform a test, right-click the analyzer on wires or mechanisms in the power grid. The device displays the following data:\n\n§eLinks§r - these include wires and mechanisms that can conduct energy (e.g., energy storage units, utility poles).\n\n§cProviders§r - all mechanisms capable of producing energy and/or feeding it into the grid (energy storage units in \"§agreen§r\" and \"§6orange§r\" modes, turbines, etc.).\n\n§9Receivers§r - everything that absorbs energy from the grid (energy storage units in \"§9blue§r\" mode, grinders, and other mechanisms).\n\n§2The analyzer not only displays the above components but also counts them. Each grid is assigned a unique code.\n\nParticles only spawn in a 20 block radius!",
