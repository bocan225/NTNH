Hover over the item of choice in NEI and press T. The container will become outlined.\n\n3) §dRandomThings§r adds Blood Moons, semi-rare events where mob spawning is increased and the player cant sleep. Blood Moons can be quite useful, if one is prepared, as rare mob drops such as §6Launch Codes§r and §6Geiger Counters§r can be obtained early on.\n\n4) §dMutant Creatures§r adds rare spawning buffed base minecraft mobs which have had their attack strength and health increased.\n\n5) §dBackhand§r backports minecraft\u0027s off-hand. Use your off-hand to hold torches, or even food while mining.",
