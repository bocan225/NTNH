Plant two mature crops of the same type (like wheat) diagonally across from each other. Then, right-click the other two Crop Sticks with another Crop Stick to turn them into Cross Sticks. \n\n[img height\u003d100]resources:CropSticks.png[/img]\n\nA new crop will grow on the Cross Sticks, hopefully with better stats than its parents. Watch out for weeds—they can appear on Cross Sticks and destroy your crops if not removed quickly!",
