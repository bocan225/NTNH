Some of the info it gives is useful right away, some of it shines later on in progression.\n\nIf you want to hide it, type \"/igi disable\" in the chat. Type \"/igi enable\" if you want to turn it back on.\n\nThe command \"/igi config\" opens the configuration window to control its position, scale, and size.\n\nIf you need suggestions on solving TPS problems, feel free to ask for help in the NTNH Discord.",
