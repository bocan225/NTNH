To update NTM either wait for a new pack release, or better yet, head over to the config folder to the file named \"Custom Recipes\" and read the instructions form there.\n\n2) Remember to Claim your base and Chunkload your reactors using Server Utilities (from the inventory).\n\n3) Normal world generation is available in the world creation tab for those that feel like RTG may be affecting their performance.\n\n4) If shaders are glitching out try to use fancy textures.\n\n5) If you are encountering any rendering problems, try to scroll around in NEI.",
