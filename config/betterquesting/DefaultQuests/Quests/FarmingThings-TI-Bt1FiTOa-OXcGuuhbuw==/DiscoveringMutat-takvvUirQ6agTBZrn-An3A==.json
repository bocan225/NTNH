For example, planting wheat and carrots diagonally in a 2x2 grid with Cross Sticks can produce potato seeds. \n\nEach mutation has specific parent crops, and some require special conditions, like certain soil or nearby blocks (check NEI for recipes). \n\nYour task is to crossbreed wheat and carrots to discover potato seeds. Be patient—mutations are random, and weeds might appear. If you get a weed, break it immediately to protect your crops!",
