You can obtain seeds by clicking on a grass block with a hoe. Pam\u0027s Harvestcraft adds new crops and recipes for unique dishes. Spice of Life increases health through food variety, while monotony reduces saturation. Track your diet in the Food Book (book + carrot).\n\nAlso, don\u0027t forget about the luchbag/lunchbox, which you can open by right-clicking. Place food inside, close it, and use it as an automatic food dispenser to maintain your diet. Just press Shift + right-click to open it, and you can eat.\n\nDiversify your diet to thrive!",
