      "desc:8": "The §3RBMK§r is a modular boiling-water type nuclear fission reactor which consists entirely of concrete columns. Each of these columns is either blank or has a specific function that it performs such as holding fuel rods, moderating neutrons, or storing §bWater§r to be boiled into §bSteam§r. Each column will also exchange heat with the column next to it such that temperature differences between columns will gradually equalize within the reactor. If any column reaches §e1500°C§r, the reactor will explode incredibly violently, spraying scrap and immensely radioactive material in every direction.\n\nDue to the complex and expansive nature of the RBMK, it is highly recommend that the wiki is checked out as it provides more information.\n\n[url]https://nucleartech.wiki/wiki/RBMK[/url]\n\n§2This quest provides an optional retrieval task for a cheap and safe RBMK design which can produce High-Performance Solvent§r §2without cooling. Simply Place the RBMK Irradiation Channel next to the RBMK Fuel Rod, apply the covers on the collumns and surround them with a solid block.",
