Schrabidium also makes for great reactor fuel. It can be created from exposing uranium ore to radiation using either a nuclear weapon or, more easily, by exploding Radioactive Barrels found in the abandoned nuclear powerplants found in deserts.\n\nWhen holding Schrabidium, the player will receive the blindness effect, so it is recommended that a Suit which provides protection from both Bright Lights and Radiation is used.",
