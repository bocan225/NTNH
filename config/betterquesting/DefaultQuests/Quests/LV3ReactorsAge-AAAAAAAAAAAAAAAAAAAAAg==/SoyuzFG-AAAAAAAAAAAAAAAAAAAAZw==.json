      "desc:8": "The §3Soyuz-FG Rocket§r is an immensely powerful Soviet rocket that is the primary launch vehicle for all satellites. The rocket must be launched from a suitably large mount - in this case, the §3Soyuz Launch Platform§r.\n\nIt requires 128,000mB of §bKerosene§r and §bLiquid Oxygen§r to be launched as well as §e750kHE§r of power. Pressing the launch button starts a 30 second countdown. After the countdown has completed, the Soyuz will launch.\n\nThe Soyuz can, alongside its primary ability to deliver any satellite to orbit, also be set to a cargo mode, in which it can deliver any provided cargo to a distant spot across the world. Obviously, this is an incredibly expensive way to transport goods, and currently doesn\u0027t provide much utility.\n\nThe Soyuz is also the only rocket able to launch §6Gerald§r.\n\n§2Blueprints for the Soyuz can be found in structures or purchased through Bobmazon.\n",
