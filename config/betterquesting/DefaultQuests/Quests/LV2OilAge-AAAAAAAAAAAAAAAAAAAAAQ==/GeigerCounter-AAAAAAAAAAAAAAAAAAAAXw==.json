It can measure three different types of radiation, those types being chunk radiation, environmental radiation and player contamination.\n\nIt can be used in one of two forms, either as a hand-held item or in its block form.\n\nHolding it in the inventory will show a meter on the bottom left of the screen, and right clicking while holding it will send a message in chat showing the various doses of radiation.\n\nIt will also click whenever it reads any kind of radiation, a signature function of any dosimeter.",
