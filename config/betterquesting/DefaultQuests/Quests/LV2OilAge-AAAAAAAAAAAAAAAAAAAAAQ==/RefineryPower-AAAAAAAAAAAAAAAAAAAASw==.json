      "desc:8": "Oil products can be combusted or burnt to produce massive amounts of energy.\n\nThe Industrial Combustion Engine combusts fuels, such as heating oil or petroleum gas to produce power. Various piston sets exist, which are needed for the engine to work, each one giving its own efficiency bonuses to fuel grades.\n\nThe Turbofan is the best place to use Aviation type fuels, such as kerosene, as it provides 100% power efficiency. Be careful not to stand infront of it while its operational!\n\nThe Flare Stack is used for burning Gasses such as Unsaturated Hydrocarbons for power, aswell as dealing with excess fluids.\n\nThe CCGT burns gaseous fuels at 100% efficiency, with a 100,000 mB fuel tank and a 16,000 mB lubricant tank required for operation. It has an on/off switch, a 0-100% fuel intake slider, and a display showing energy output per second. An \"AUTO\" button toggles throttling to match grid demand, saving fuel. It can use water to produce dense steam for extra energy. Primarily used for petroleum and reformate gas, it\u0027s the most powerful combustible fuel generator.\n\nRedstone-Over radio in combination with a comparator and a Redstone Fluid Valve can be used to detect when a tank is starting to fill up, and release the insides. This is useful for having buffers without having all the fluids being wasted.",
