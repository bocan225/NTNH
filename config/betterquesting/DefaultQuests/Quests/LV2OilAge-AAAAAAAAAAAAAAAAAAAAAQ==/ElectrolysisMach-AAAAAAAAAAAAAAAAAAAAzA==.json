      "desc:8": "The §3Electrolysis Machine§r enables the separating of elements from fluids and the advanced processing of ores, making it an important machine in ore processing. Operating the machine consumes §e200kHE/s§r.\n\nThe electrolysis machine has 2 functions: one for the separation of fluids and one for ore processing.\n\nIn the first mode, the machine will take in a compatible fluid and separate it into 2 other fluids.\n\nIn the second mode, it will require §bNitric Acid§r and will process any kind of ore-derived crystal, allowing the maximum yield of the ore. There are 2 outputs, for the molten main product the outlet marked green and the secondary the one marked red, plus a byproduct kept in its item form. The outlets follow the same mechanics as the §3Crucible§r.\n\n§2Consider installing a Power Saving upgrade above level 2 on the electrolysis machine as it will significantly reduce the power consumption with only a minimal speed penalty.",
