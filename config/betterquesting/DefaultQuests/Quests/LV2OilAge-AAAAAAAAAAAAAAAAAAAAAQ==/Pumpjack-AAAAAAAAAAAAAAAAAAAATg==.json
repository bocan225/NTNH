It depletes a single block of a deposit after extracting a random number of cycles of oil that is on average twice as large compared to the derrick.\n\nIn total, this means that the pumpjack is on average 3x as efficient at extracting oil and 3x as fast at doing so while producing the same amount of natural gas as the derrick.",
