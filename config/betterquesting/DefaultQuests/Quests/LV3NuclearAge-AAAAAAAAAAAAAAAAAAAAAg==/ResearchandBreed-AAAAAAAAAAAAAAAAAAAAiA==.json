      "desc:8": "The §3Research Reactor§r is a non-power reactor intended for burning fuel efficiently and acting as a neutron source for §3Breeding Reactor§ss§r. It has to be submerged in §bWater§r to cool since it does not have the active cooling of a typical power reactor. A §6Ra226Be§r or §6Pu238Be§r neutron source plate is needed to begin the reaction, and then can be removed. It explodes at exactly §e1,000°C§r, so caution is advised when using strong fuels and several breeders simultaneously.\n\nA §3Reactor Remote Control§  Block§r\nand a §6Reactor Remote Sensor§r can be used to activate and monitor the reactor from a distance.\n\nThe Breeding Reactor breeds isotopes of elements into heavier forms using the neutron flux of an adjacent Research Reactor. When the reactor is operating, rays of green-ish \"lightning\" emitted from the center rod of the model can be seen going to the outer rods from the glass observation window.",
