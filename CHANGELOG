# 2.2.0 Release
### Worldgen performance should be considerably improved with this update!

## What's changed?
**Added**
- MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod
- Powered drill
   └ Gasoline-fueled mining drill with AoE
   └ Uses the gun system and therefore does not have configurable abilities
   └ Mining level of iron tools by default
   └ AoE, melee damage, reach and mining level can be upgraded with drill bits
   └ Mining speed and fuel used can be changed with engines (diesel, aviation, electric, turbo)
   └ Fortune can be added as mods (both mods do in fact stack, yielding fortune III)
   └ Not a precision tool, intended to be used alongside pickaxes instead of replacing them
   └ Despite this, sneaking allows the AoE to be disabled
   └ Unlike pickaxes, shows a preview for what area is to be mined
   └ Due to not being considered a tool like a vanilla one, it's not affected by dig speed penalties from fatigue, being underwater or on a ladder
- Pipe anchor
   └ Works like a electricity connector but for fluids
   └ Range of 10 blocks
   └ Can be connected using a pipe wrench
- T-51b power armor
   └ Serves as a replacement for the T-45
- Depressurization effects!
   └ Breaking any sealed room will cause depress event, which will suck entities through the hole, if they fit
- Added a few interesting and helpful resourcepacks

**Fixed**
- Fixed screen flickering when looking at players
- Fixed slow world loading
- Fixed rewards for some AE2 quests
   └ "Dense ME Cable", "ME Dual Interface", "ME Storage Bus", "Wireless Terminal" and "Dual P2P Interface" specificly.
- Fixed weird bug caused by changing BetterPlacement settings
- Potentially fixed a crash on thermos-derived servers involving the flow control pumps
- Fixed crash caused when another tile entity replaces an RBMK component due to an unchecked cast
- Fixed constant cascading chunk gen caused by meteorites and flower patches
- Fixed garbage loot pool sometimes producing "stone wires"
- Fixed mining lasers targeting blocks with the "gas" material
- Fixed gun looping sounds behaving weird when moving while firing
- Fixed an issue where weapon mods with the highest stat change priority would break the mod sorting, leading to inconsistent behavior
- Fixed fluid container items breaking when NBT is attached to them
- Potentially fixed a mod conflict where corium fluid would crash when flowing into wate
- Fixed a potential crash caused by inserters connected to multiblocks that don't have a core tile
- Players in different pressurized rooms are affected by depressurization
- Light dummies for multiblocks are placeable and crash the game
- A few more recursion crashes on light dummies
- A whole lot of worldgen cascading on Moho, Tekto, and others
- Fixed wood burner only being able to create one ash pile per item burned, even when that item yields more, creating a backlog in the internal ash value
- Fixed some QMAW link icons not having the correct block lighting applied
- Fixed a rare crash caused by RBMK neutron calculations happening in unloaded chunks
- Fixed moonstone recipe being broken
- Crash when using a linked stardar console after removing the stardar
- Crash when dying in orbit

**Changed**
- **NTNH Vanilled resourcepack was temporarily removed to fix MMC/Prism extraction issue!**
- Added reward for "Fluix Crystal" quest
- Removed Deconstruction table
   └ Cry about it
      └ Probably temporarily, until I fix the performance and fairness of this block (did you know that you can disassemble chainmail and get FIRE?)
- Removed Extra Utilities mention from the "Numbers in the Corner?" quest
- Removed "Vanilla changes" quest
- Removed "Farming and Cooking" questline
   └ To be reworked
- Updated "A Feast of Variety" quest
- Reduced spawn rate for aggressive mobs
- Increased spawn rate for passive mobs
- Added "Storage Drawer Keys" quest
- Added "Steel Furnace" quest
- Updated russian and chinese localization
- VNT type explosions now track affected block positions when the explosion events fire, this should ensure compatibility with mods that rely on that
   └ For example, this should make ForgeCreeperHeal work with most of NTM's explosions
- Obliterated standard fluid IDs
   └ The multi ID is now a lot cheaper
   └ For convenience in the creative tab, fluid IDs are now listed with all fluids pre-defined, just like how the old IDs were available
   └ The multi ID now changes metadata based on the selected fluid type, allowing it to be usable for crafting pre-defined pipes
- The multi ID fluid selector now displays fluid traits in addition to the name when hovering over an icon
- Added more values to the data table returned by RBMK consoles via OC integration
- The conveyor ejector now has a "only take maximum possible" toggle
   └ Enabling this means that, if stack ejection upgrades are installed, only stacks that meet the limit can be ejected
   └ Items with a lower maximum stacksize will be ejected regardless
- Survey scanners now pick up bedrock oil
- The conveyor sorter filter slots now have directional labels instead of only color coding
   └ Apparently color blind people exist?
- Conveyor sorters can now process boxes
   └ All stacks are sorted individually, and each batch of items that comes out of one side is sent as a box
- Conveyor boxers can now accept boxes, this is useful for batching up partial boxes that come out of sorters
- Conveyor inserters can now accept boxes directly instead of causing them to burst open
- Conveyor inserters now have a special rule when supplying an arc furnace where instead of trying a full stack and then one item, the first always failing and the last being too slow, they will supply the slot target amount instead
   └ Given the cycle delay and the lid's movement speed, the inserters should now be fast enough to fully supply a speed III arc furnace
- Skeletons can now be gibbed by explosions, although it will spawn clean bone particles and omit the gore splash effect
- Polymer power tools now only have AoE 1 instead of AoE 2
- The fluid container NEI handler now also includes the empty container, making it easier to find what fluids a canister for example is usable for
- Changed Mk2 infinite water barrel to use generic cast parts instead of a very specific type of pipe
- Retextured the multi fluid IDs to look more like the old IDs they replaced
- Logistics provider and requester crates can now only connect to a path node if that path is a dedicated waypoint
   └ This means that requesters and providers will no longer connect automatically, a logistics net now requires at least one dedicated waypoint
   └ This also means that in larger networks with many providers and requesters, all the useless connections between them which scale exponentially will no longer exist
   └ This is a band-aid fix for logistics nets destroying the game even at lower scales due to the path finding being unperformant as hell
   └ The system will have to be reworked entirely sooner or later (ough)
- PWR parts have been moved from the workbench to the assembler
   └ Some oil proc machines are now a tad cheaper
   └ Extensive boards now use four rubber bars instead of gold wires
   └ The CCGT is now considerably cheaper, using similar materials as a turbofan
   └ Fusion reactors now use welded tc/cd alloy again
   └ 256k tanks now use half as much steel
   └ Gerald is now way more expensive
   └ PWR parts are now subject to expensive mode
- Fluid container items now keep their custom name when filling or emptying
- Pneumatic tube endpoints now have a GUI that allows filters to be defined
- Fortune on a drillbit now affects the quality of mined bedrock ore, each level of fortune adds 10% of the value to the item
- The arc furnace now has a five slot input queue which accepts full stacks
   └ This removes the need for weird, hacky, buggy special implementations for inserters to work at a reasonable speed
   └ This also means that pneumatic tubes and other mods' automation systems can now insert into the arc furnace with little issue
   └ Should the mode change and items in the input queue no longer be usable, they automatically become ejectable via automation
   └ The input queue slots are always accessible, not just when the lid is open
- Removed all the NTM sand mix blocks and replaced them with a single block that uses metadata
- Removed all tiers of the deprecated PA power plugs except one, leaving the old PAs just barely operational
- Ike now has more common sellafield craters, and they are more radioactive than on Earth
- Added more QMAW pages
- Removed most old particle accelerator blocks from the creative inventory
- All dual wielded guns now render more accurately when dropped instead of only showing one gun
- Added support for left handed guns (currently unused)*
- Removed the presentations for the old particle accelerator and schottky diode
- Gibbing NPCs now also spawns bones, if supported by the skeletonizer
   └ Gibbed bones only have a 50% chance of spawning and come with a unique red texture
   └ Gibbed bones have a way shorter lifetime and higher gravity to match the gib particles
- Updated the factory structure
- Drills no longer clip through depth rock, depth rock now has to be cleared before bedrock ore becomes accessible
- When an area modifier is selected on a tool, an icon will now render next to the crosshair to make it obvious that the modifier is active
- Crucibles will now produce a smoke effect when producing pollution, making it more obvious where the pollution is coming from
- Halved the amount of schrabidic acid needed in the schrabidium recipes in the PUREX, increasing the defacto yield per used fuel rod
- Changed thorium salt enrichment recipe from 5s to 1s
- There are now two new alternate recipes for making solid fuel in the chemical plant out of biomass
- The helium-3 recipe no longer requires batches of 8, the input, duration and output have been divided equally
- Helium-4 can now be filled into gas tanks
R- einforced concrete can now also be created by filling rebar with liquid concrete in the acidizer
- Graphite electrodes can now be made in the chemical plant from either heating oil or lubricant
- Lubricant can now be made in the chemical plant from either coal tar or heavy oil
- The cracking tower and coker are now cheaper in expensive mode, using more bolted steel plates and fewer heavy frameworks
- Added animations to the LPW-3N
- MORE MORE MORE electrolyser ports
- PLSS will now consume O2 when underwater
- QMAW pages for zinc
